## Sample Usage:
### General Instruction
Write something on the left panel, and the markdown html result shows in real time on the right panel.

#### Have something in mind?
Got something in mind or just want to examine your markdown format? Just use the url above to start a quick markdown writing.

#### Want to stay collaborative?
Each unique path is a collaborative workboard. Simply enter the same workboard with your teammates, and all of you can start to contribute on one markdown file. </br>
(Each workboard associates with one *appurl+id*, try: https://realtime-markdown-zhaoyuan.herokuapp.com/sample-workboard)

## Future Plan
- [ ] Provide pdf download link
- [ ] UI box to enter workboard id
- [ ] Invitation links (たぶん)
- [ ] Show num of people in the workboard (たぶん)
